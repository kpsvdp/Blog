    <h1> Home Alone: The Mysterious Case</h1>
    <h2 style="color: blue;"><i> Case - 1</i></h2>
    <div class="story-section">
      <li><p class="description"></pclass> The story begins with a small town...</p></li>
        <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> A little child named Prashanth used to reside in a charming small town. He was a bright, inquisitive boy who was constantly looking for mystery and adventure. Prashanth’s parents told him they had to go to a relative’s wedding and would be gone for a day one lovely morning. Prashanth was nervous about staying home alone, but overcame it and said goodbye to his parents.   
        </P1></li> 

        <li> <img src="images A/MYSTERIOUS /Case 1/HA1.JPG" alt="">
            <p class="description"></pclass>   </p>
            <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> Prashanth kept himself busy with his toys and books throughout the day, but he couldn’t quench his curiosity. He couldn’t help but look around the house for something interesting. While digging around their room, Prashanth found an old, dusty box hidden under his parents’ bed. As he opened it, excitement lit up his eyes.   
            </P1></li>
            <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> To his surprise, the box had a number of antique photos, letters, and what appeared to be a very old map. Prashanth started looking at the pictures out of curiosity. They included strange people and locations, and the writing appeared to be in a language he wasn’t familiar with. However, he was more interested in the map because it was marked with odd symbols and marks that suggested a secret treasure.

        <p class="description"></pclass>   </p>
        <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class>Prashanth felt the excitement of a great adventure rushing through him. He made the decision to set off on a mission to unravel the mystery of the map and perhaps discover the wealth. He began his expedition with a rucksack containing food, drink, and a torch.    
        </P1></li>
        <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class>Prashanth walked across the town, navigating tucked-away lanes and secret passages as he followed the cryptic hints on the map. He came through feral animals and barking dogs, but his will never faltered. The sun began to set later in the day, leaving an amber glow across the horizon. As darkness fell, Prashanth understood he needed to move more quickly in his search.    
        </P1></li>
        <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class>A broken-down, deserted house on the outskirts of the town was where he found the final hint. Prashanth couldn’t help but continue investigating despite the ominous and dark surroundings. He stepped slowly into the house, holding on to his torch. The sensation of the floors cracking under him added to the mysterious atmosphere.    
        </P1></li>

    <p class="description"></pclass>   </p>
    <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> Prashanth discovered a secret room hidden away behind a bookcase as he made his way closer to the estate. Interesting art, old objects, and, most importantly, a treasure chest were all contained within. He opened his chest, his pulse pounding with excitement. But as soon as the chest opened, a sharp alarm rang out throughout the house, scaring Prashanth. He feared when he realized he had activated a security feature meant to keep the riches safe. He had accidentally come into a known burglar’s lair, and the police alarm had gone off.   
    </P1></li>
    <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class>Prashanth made a split-second decision to close the chest and dash out of the house. Soon after, police surrounded the residence. As Prashanth made his way through the dark tunnels in search of an exit, fear and excitement were put through him. Prashanth noticed a small opening in the wall that led to a nearby garden as the police got closer. In an effort to escape his pursuers, he dashed through it. He found himself in an unfamiliar, stunning, and beautiful garden connected to a different mansion as he came out the other side.    
    </P1></li>

    <p class="description"></pclass>   </p>
    <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> An old woman who owned the house saw Prashanth’s unkempt appearance and volunteered to help him right away. She reassured him that she would handle the problem with the police after hearing his account and calming him down. Prashanth expressed his sincere gratitude to her for her kindness.   
    </P1></li>
    <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> When Prashanth’s parents finally came back from the wedding, they were happy to see that he was okay. He made the decision to share the mysterious map and the hidden treasure trove with them as he told them about his exciting day. They paid close attention, praised his boldness, and warned him about messing with strange objects.   
    </P1></li>

    <p class="description"></pclass>   </p>
    <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class>In the end, Prashanth understood that one’s own house was always a place of safety and love and that sometimes the greatest adventures could be discovered there. From that moment on, he treasured his family and the stories of his exciting adventure, constantly reminding himself that the real value was inside his loved ones’ love and support instead of outside of them.
