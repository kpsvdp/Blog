        <li> <img src="images A/UNIVERSAL /Universal 4/old.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="description"></pclass>   </p>
            <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> I have to tell you about the most beautiful love story I witnessed today. It was such a touching experience that I just had to share it with you.   
            </P1></li>
            <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class>As I strolled around the park, taking in the pleasant rays of the sun and the delicious aroma of newly budding flowers, I caught sight of an old couple relaxing on a bench. They were holding hands and exchanging intense looks. It was obvious that they had been together for a very long time since their love was so evident.    
            </P1></li> 
            <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class>I heard their chat as I got closer. The woman was explaining to the man that she was aware that her time on this planet was dwindling*. She knew it was only a matter of time before she had to say goodbye because she was old and exhausted.    
            </P1></li>
            <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> The man held her hand tightly and told her he loved her more than anything. He promised to be by her side until the end and to cherish every moment they had left together. Tears streamed down my face as I watched this beautiful display of love and devotion. It was clear that this couple had been through so much together and that their love had only grown stronger over the years.   
            </P1></li> 
            <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> I couldn’t help but think of our own friends and how lucky we are to have each other in our lives. I hope we can grow old together, just like this couple, and continue to support and love each other through life’s ups and downs.   
            </P1></li>
        
      </li>
      <li> <P2 class="custom-font-size"></P2class> “ This tale is a true reminder of the effect and strength of enduring love. Inspiring us to value and treasure the important relationships we have in our own life”.</P2></P2> </li>
              <li> <P2 class="custom-font-size"></P2class>  ...........................</P2></P2> </li>
