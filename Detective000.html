                  <h2> Cloudy Investigation </h2>
                  <h3>Probe 01</h3> <hr/>
                  
      <p> <span class="image left"><img src="images/Mystery Pic/2 mens investgating/cip1-1.jpg" alt="" /><b></b></span> 
            The area was covered in an extraordinary quiet all through the late hours of the night, sometimes disturbed only by the faraway scream of an owl. Even though Venkat, a seasoned private investigator, was used to these kinds of nights, something felt off tonight. A knock on the wooden door sounded softly as he sat in his poorly lit office, lost in paperwork. He was taken aback to see Rishi, his former partner and buddy, standing in the doorway.<br>
            With a low, serious voice, Rishi stated, "Venkat, we have got a case."<br>
            "What's going on, Rishi?" Impressed by his friend's urgent tone, Venkat inquired.<br>
            "There was a terrible accident just a few blocks away," Rishi clarified. After hitting a girl with their vehicle, the man driving rushed away quickly. The family has asked for our assistance, and the police are overworked."<br>
            It attracted Venkat's curiosity. During the years, he and Rishi had worked on a lot of cases together, but this one felt especially strange. They quickly gathered all of their belongings and headed to the scene of the incident.<br>
            It was a freezing night with constant fog that made things seem a little cloudy. They noticed a gathering of people crying and praying as they got closer to the scene. The girl, with a white sheet covering her, lay on the road, lifeless. Later on, they found out her name was Meera.
            </p>

      <p> <span class="image right"><img src="images/Mystery Pic/2 mens investgating/cip1-2.jpg" alt="" /><b></b></span> 
            "Explain what happened," Venkat asked an outsider.<br>
            The man in his middle age who was the witness described the incidents, shivering in his voice. "While walking my dog, I heard tires screeching loudly. When I got there, Meera was lying there. The motorist continued. Everything happened so quickly and horribly."<br>
            Venkat and Rishi looked around, trying to find any evidence of their presence. On the road, they discovered tire prints showing them the vehicle's route before taking off. They saw a damaged side mirror close by, which may indicate that the car was damaged in the crash.<br>
            They learned that Meera was a college student who was well-known for her kindness and intelligence when they investigated deeper into the case. But no one appeared to be particularly aware of her private life or any possible enemies. They talked to her instructors, family, and friends, but nothing stood out as the reason behind the hit-and-run.<br>
            Frustrated, they went back to their office, ready to track down a lead. They combed through all of the evidence till late at night in an attempt to solve the problem that was in front of them.
            </p>

      <p> <span class="image left"><img src="images/Mystery Pic/2 mens investgating/cip1-3.jpg" alt="" /><b></b></span>
            And then there was an unidentified call. The caller informed them of a nearby repair shop that had just fixed a car with serious front-end damage and a broken side mirror. Although the person who provided the information was unable to identify the car, they believed it was important to look into it.<br>
            Venkat and Rishi followed the lead, and when they got to the garage, the owner was afraid to greet them. The owner of the garage ultimately admitted that he had fixed a vehicle that fit their description after a bit of convincing.<br>
            Rishi inquired, "Who brought it in?",<br>
            "I am not sure. The garage owner answered, "It was a guy trying to hide his face with a cap and sunglasses." 
            </p>

      <p> <span class="image right"><img src="images/Mystery Pic/2 mens investgating/cip1-4.jpg" alt="" /><b></b></span>
            With this vital piece of knowledge, Venkat and Rishi began to reduce the number of people they had on their suspect list. They located a possible suspect after carefully going over surveillance footage from surrounding cameras and discovering a blurry picture of the vehicle used in the hit-and-run.<br>
            It was discovered that the suspect was a person with a criminal history who had engaged in criminal behaviour and driven recklessly in the past. The case took an unexpected turn when they narrowed in on the culprit.<br>
            A suspicious letter warning Meera's family to stop their inquiry was sent to them. The letter had no return address and was written in blood-red ink. This helped strengthen Venkat and Rishi's determination to see Meera's and her family's rights upheld.<br>
            Since the criminal always seemed to be one step ahead of them, the case turned into a race against time. Venkat and Rishi put in a lot of overtime, following leads, making connections between things, and applying their knowledge and calculating to find the truth. 
            </p>

      <p> <span class="image left"><img src="images/Mystery Pic/2 mens investgating/cip1-5.jpg" alt="" /><b></b></span>
            In the end, following numerous restless evenings and wonderful experiences, Venkat and Rishi succeeded in capturing the culprit and determining the reason for the hit-and-run. The case involved a mistaken identity and a personal grudge from the suspect's background.<br>
            The accident occurred because the person who caused it didn't want to hurt Meera; instead, the cloudy night made it difficult to identify her. Fearing the worst, the culprit ran away, hoping to avoid punishment.

<!------------------------------------------------- Blockquote ----------------------------------------->
<blockquote><p><span class="image Fit right"><img src="images/Mystery Pic/2 mens investgating/cip1-6.jpg" alt="" /><b> </b></span><b>Even though justice was served, the mysterious circumstances surrounding the case disturbed Venkat and Rishi. Their emotional roller coaster of a late-night investigation had exposed the darker part of human nature hiding in the dark corners of the night. They were worn out when they got home, but the knowledge that they had given Meera's family closure made the restless night worthwhile. </b></blockquote>
