 <h3>Chapter 02</h3>

      <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Author Pic/chapter 2/SA.jpg" alt="Prince’s First Day of School" /><b><cite>Prince’s First Day of School</cite></b></span> 
      <br>
      <p> The prince was nervous as he woke up early on his first day of school. He had been looking forward to starting school for months, but as the day finally arrived, he was filled with anxiety. He dressed in his new school uniform, which his mother had purchased for him with great care, and ate a quick breakfast before heading out the door.<br>
      <br>
       As he walked to school, the prince’s nerves only grew stronger. He worried about making friends, fitting in, and understanding all the lessons his teacher would teach him. When he arrived at the school, he saw many other children walking in the same direction and tried to smile at them. A few of them smiled back, which made Prince feel a little better.
      </p>
     
       <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Author Pic/chapter 2/SA1.jpg" alt="" /><b></b></span>
       <br>
       <p> When Prince walked into the classroom, his teacher greeted him warmly and introduced him to the rest of the class. All the other children turned to look at him, and Prince felt a little self-conscious. However, the teacher quickly went back to her lesson, and the other children returned their attention to her.
            <br><br>
            As the day went on, Prince felt more at ease because he discovered that he already understood some of the information the teacher was covering. He made a few friends and played games with them at recess. When the last bell sounded, Prince was exhausted but content. Prince came to the conclusion that his first day wasn’t all that horrible as he made his way home from school. He had made a few new friends, discovered a few things, and even enjoyed himself.
            <br><br>
            Prince felt more excited than nervous for his next day of school and knew that he would have a great time at school this year.
