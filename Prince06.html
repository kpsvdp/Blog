                  <blockquote><p><span class="image Fit"><img src="" alt="" /><b></b></span>
                        <b><i> The beautiful state of Chhattisgarh is where the narrator begins.</i></b></p></blockquote>
                        <br>
       <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Author Pic/chapter 6/LS.jpg" alt="" /><b></b></span>
       <p> Once upon a time, a young prince discovered himself in a completely different world in the beautiful state of Chhattisgarh. Prince was his name, and he was from Andhra Pradesh. Telugu was his native tongue. He and his parents moved to Chhattisgarh in the middle of his fifth-grade academic year due to a variety of reasons.
             </p>
             <br>
        <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Author Pic/chapter 6/LS1.jpg" alt="" /><b></b></span> 
            <p>  They received a warm welcome from the locals, and Prince soon began attending the prestigious D.A.V. Public School, known for its outstanding academics. But he immediately ran into an important challenge because he had trouble speaking Hindi, the dominant tongue in the area.
                  <br><br>
            Prince had a limited understanding of Hindi because he was from a different state and had grown up speaking another language, making it challenging for him to speak clearly and fluently. He found it difficult to understand his lessons, take part in class discussions, and communicate with his classmates due to the limitations of his language. Weeks turned into days, and Prince became increasingly irritated. He frequently found himself in the classroom alone, feeling confused by the rush of Hindi conversations going on all around him. Although the teachers and his classmates made an effort to be understanding, the prince found it challenging to participate in class or make friends due to his ineffective communication skills.
            <br><br>
            In addition to the language challenge, Prince had academic difficulties. In comparison to what he had previously learned, the syllabus at Dav Public School was more advanced. He was unfamiliar with ideas that had been covered at his previous school. He felt increasingly alone in this strange environment due to the combination of his language difficulties and academic difficulties.
             </p>
             <br>
      <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Author Pic/chapter 6/LS2.jpg" alt="" /><b>Nikita & Prince</b></span>
      <p> He was sitting by himself one day during playtime when an understanding girl named Nikita caught his attention. She approached the prince out of interest and made her introduction. She made the decision to be his friend and guide after learning about his problems. Nikita would slowly translate lessons for him, breaking down difficult ideas into terms he understood completely. 
             </p>
             <br>
       <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Author Pic/chapter 6/LS3.jpg" alt="" /><b></b></span>
            <p> Prince’s understanding of Hindi gradually increased with Nikita’s help, and he began to feel more comfortable in class. When the other students realized he wasn’t as different from them as they had initially thought, they also began including him in group activities. Nikita and the prince’s teachers also learned of the prince’s hidden talents. Despite his language difficulties, he demonstrated exceptional talent in the classroom and, to the teacher’s surprise, received good grades in the middle of his academic year. He received honors. He improved his communication abilities, and the prince received the greatest congratulations from all the school’s teachers. 
             </p>
             <br>
      <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Author Pic/chapter 6/LS4.jpg" alt="" /><b></b></span> 
            <p> As his confidence developed, Prince began to perform well in many academic subjects, in addition to excelling in all of his extracurricular activities. He made a lot of effort to catch up on his schoolwork, and with the help of his new friends, he performed admirably. People were initially curious about the boy who had trouble understanding Hindi, but as the prince’s story spread throughout the school, that interest changed to admiration for the boy’s determination and bravery. He made the most of the chance that his difficulties provided and earned the respect of all people in his surrounding area.
