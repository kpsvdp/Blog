            <p>Parent’s words: He’s here; he’s finally here! Little Prince was born on the most beautiful day of the year, a sunny and warm Friday, August 15, 1997, weighing 7.3 lbs and 20.3 inches long. The emotions and experiences are hard to put into words.
            <br><br>
            <b>“Remember, revealing the prince’s name soon requires careful consideration and dignity.”</b>

           <br>
            <p>With their neighbor, parents began to celebrate "Prince's First Birthday." Little Prince's parents were not pleased with the birthday celebration because they lived in an area that was inaccessible to them. For what reason? Prince Father is unable to settle down because he works for the government. It is going to be necessary to move him around.
                  <br><br>
               The Surat government employed the prince’s father. When he was twelve years old, his father passed away. Prince's father eventually succeeds in getting a job and gets married at the age of thirty, after countless obstacles. So, there are many struggles, but the prince’s father is happy with his son's birth. He thinks that my son should not struggle with life and money. I should give him the best life and education.

            <p>Little Prince's mother is a homemaker. She will keep her husband and child in a healthy and happy atmosphere at home. She will understand her husband's problems in any case. She will take care of her child because she has no interest in meeting her parents. Why? Because her parents mostly like Big Brother and Small Sister. Their brother and sister also have such a selfish mindset, but the prince's mother likes there brother and sister.
                  <br><br>
               Prince's parents' marriage happens like a miracle. In the year 1996, March 8th, Thursday suddenly happened by God Script. Prince’s father and family members went to the wrong house. Prince’s father and mother see each other.They suddenly completed their engagement that day. Knowing the truth that the wrong place came from Prince Father. Prince’s parents' family was shocked and thought about further things to do. They decide to marry them.
