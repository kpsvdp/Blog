            <p class="description"></pclass> Unhappy story……..</p>
            <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> A boy named xxx lived in a small town hiding between low mountains and struggled with a variety of problems that weighed heavily on him. Without his overprotective parents and a small group of close friends, XXX discovered that he was unable to succeed. He felt lost and anxious since just the thought of being alone gave him a headache.   
            </P1></li>
            <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class>   He was unable to concentrate or find motivation to do well in his studies, making studying a constant struggle. xxx ideas were somewhere else, as he did not work to pay attention to the information presented to him in class. 
            </P1></li> 
            <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> The body was frail, prone to illness, and exhausted. His body kept up with him in spite of his best efforts to lead a healthy lifestyle, which made him feel even more helpless. The financial struggles of his family increased the situation by creating an ongoing pattern of limitations and missed opportunities.   
            </P1></li>
            <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> His self-doubt and unhappiness made it difficult for him to build relationships. Xxx longed for a girlfriend to share his life with, but he was unable to understand why anyone would want to be with someone who was so troubled and unhappy.   
            </P1></li>
            <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> Eventually, xxx’s struggles became too much for him to handle. He was stuck in a cycle of hopelessness, unable to escape his lonely and dark path. The young boy’s hopes and dreams gradually vanished, leaving him to live in isolation and sadness forever.
