                  <h2> Strong Friendship bond </h2>
                  <h3> Chapter 05 </h3> <hr/>

            But one day, Prince’s father was transferred to a new city for work, and the family had to leave Karminagar. Prince was devastated to leave his friends and the town he had called home for so long. As the moving day approached, he spent his final moments in Karminagar bidding farewell to his friends, promising to keep in touch, and hoping that one day they would reunite.

      <p> <span class="image left"><img src="images/Author Pic/chapter 5/SFB2.JPG" alt="" /><b>Prince & Solomon</b></span>
            Prince’s loneliness started to disappear as the days grew into weeks. Solomon introduced him to a group of pals who were happy to have Prince around. They took him on a tour of the city, told him stories, and incorporated him into their plans. Since leaving Karminagar, Prince has not experienced a sense of belonging. <br>
            Moving Prince to the new city wasn’t an easy process. He struggled to adjust to the unusual surroundings, the congested streets, and the massive buildings that had replaced Karminagar’s serene environs. Every night, he missed the warm embrace of his previous home and seeing his loved ones.

            Prince’s parents, however, became aware of his difficulties and chose to enroll him in a new school that placed a strong emphasis on friendship and community. Prince arrived at school on his first day with a heavy heart, apprehensive of what lay ahead. But he had no idea that fate had something special in store for him.<br>
            During the school assembly, a child by the name of Solomon was beaming, and Prince looked up at him. Prince discovered that Solomon had also recently moved to the city as their time spent together grew. Their study companions had been assigned to them. Due to their shared experiences and yearning for their former homes, they bonded quite quickly.<br>
            But when their teachers observed them remaining silent, they surmised that it indicated a lack of passion. They perceived their reserved attitude as an indication of a lack of interest in their studies. In an effort to get Prince and Solomon to participate more actively in class, the teachers started reprimanding them out of exasperation and concern.

      <p> <span class="image left"><img src="images/Author Pic/chapter 5/SFB4.JPG" alt="" /><b>Prince and Solomon, upset and confused</b></span>
            Prince and Solomon, upset and confused, struggled to understand why they were being treated in this way. They were conscious of their diligence as students, but they nevertheless felt unworthy in light of their teachers’ actions. Despite their worries, they were resolute that they would not let the situation bring them down.<br>
            When they were alone, having their lunch in the school courtyard one afternoon, Prince broke the silence. “Solomon, I don’t understand why anyone doesn’t appear to be worried about us. Is there something strange about us? Solomon looked up with a sad expression on his face. I’ve been wondering, Prince, just like you. Though it might not be about us, It might have to do with the others. They could be busy with themselves to the point where they fail to see others.<br>
            Prince nodded intently. “You could be right. It’s disheartening to be made to feel invisible and have our efforts neglected. But I won’t let this constrain us. While we don’t have much control over how other people perceive us, we do have control over our own actions and attitudes. Following their conversation, Prince and Solomon decided to channel their energies into something positive. They embarked on a journey to get through the barriers of isolation and contempt. They decided to alter things for everyone who could be suffering in silence, not just for themselves. 
            </p>

            Prince and Solomon planned a number of minor activities and projects for the school with the help of a few sympathetic teachers who recognized their potential. They established a club where students could interact and share stories, with a particular emphasis on encouraging compassion and inclusivity.<br>
            As soon as the school heard about Prince and Solomon’s efforts, things started to change gradually but steadily. Students who had previously walked by them took note of their commitment and kindness.

            Sometime later, the two friends are experiencing their best relationship bond when their lives take an unexpected turn.<br>
            Solomon’s reaction to Prince’s disclosure was shock. A friendship that lasted six months was uncertain about its future. They promised to keep in touch because their bond was unbreakable. Distance wouldn’t damage their relationship.<br>
            <b>Now, as the prince departs the city, that day has arrived.</b> <br>
            In a touching farewell, Solomon gave Prince a fond farewell. They promised to keep their memories forever as tears filled their eyes. While Solomon prayed in silence for his friend’s achievement, the entire world anticipated Prince’s genius. They said goodbye in a warm embrace, confident that their friendship would last despite time and distance.
