            <p2>Love is a powerful energy that has the power to either cause or heal the most painful injuries. Though it sometimes leaves us silently, holding onto memories rather than hands, it whispers promises of forever. It tells us that even broken hearts may heal and start to beat again.</p2>

      <blockquote><p><b><i>Day Comes…</i></b></p></blockquote>
       <br>
      <p>Early in the morning, I wake up, waiting for what will happen when the first rays of sunlight lightly touch the land. I am eagerly awaiting her reaction and the words and ideas she will share with me. I look forward to this routine every day because it's a special time when time appears to stop, and I can only wonder what she will share. Her words shine on my day ahead, shining like a ray of cheerfulness, energy, and a deep feeling of connection.
      </p> 
      <br>             
      <p> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Love&Break Pic/Splove2/sl2.1.jpg" alt="" /><b>"Sai was hanging out with his friends."</b></span> 
            When she finally arrived at our arranged meeting place in the beautiful home park, she gave me a warm hug, her presence quickly calming my racing heart. Her eyes met mine as she slowly withdrew, expressing how much she had missed our moments together. "I have been looking forward to feeling your hug and kiss again after such a long time," she said in an emotional voice. I cannot express how much I have missed you. This emotional meeting was an important reminder of our close relationship and the value of each moment we have together.
            <br> <br>     
            We had a deep discussion regarding the recent family get-together while seated next to each other in the peaceful park. She says, slightly laughing, how my crazy requests caught her by surprise, and even about my crazy actions in front of our parents. We mix conversations about our academic goals, our friendships with friends, and the complex relationships of our families in between our memories of the passion that once sparked our affection, putting together our common past and future goals.
      </P>  
      <br>
      <p> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Love&Break Pic/Splove2/sl2.2.jpg" alt="" /><b></b> A Full Day……</span> 
            Our conversation at the park this morning flowed into the afternoon, indicating the beginning of a day full of happy moments and memories that we would share. By lunchtime, we were having lunch at a little local restaurant, enjoying tasty food, and talking more. After lunch, we went shopping, navigating the busy streets and shops as we gathered little items from our day spent together.  
            <br> <br>
            The most enjoyable part of our afternoon was watching the film "Endukante... Premanta!" which was an imaginary and romantic touch to our day. We went to a small restaurant with amazing views of the lake and had dinner by candlelight as midnight set in. There we ate dinner together, laughing, talking deeply, and making plans for the future, all while enjoying the peaceful backdrop of the lake and the warm glow of the candles. After a pleasant late-night trip home, we reflected on the wonderful times we had experienced, enjoying our relationship even more with every moment that passed.
      </P>

      <p> <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Love&Break Pic/Splove2/sl2.3.jpg" alt="" /><b></b></span>
            That night, she had to be admitted to the hospital right away due to a serious condition. My uncle called me in a panic, saying Sweety had been brought to the hospital because she was having respiratory problems. My dad and I hurried to the hospital, anxious and desperate to be by her side, hoping for her quick recovery and longing to see her well again.
            <br> <br>
            Sweety's condition in the intensive care unit is getting worse every day, and her health is gradually declining. Her parents, anxious for better treatment, took the painful decision to send her to Apollo Hospital in Hyderabad, where she would get specialist medical care that would hopefully help her fight for recovery.
            <br> <br>
            My daily routine changed once we got back from our vacation. I started going to the hospital every day because I felt the need to be close to her. This ritual became my comfort and my reason for being present as I walked the halls in sorrow, desperate to spend even a single moment with her, holding onto hope in the face of doubt.
      </p>

      <blockquote><p><b><i>"And that's where the story pauses," Sai concluded, his voice a soft echo in the night. "I don't know what will happen to her but she is everything to me." </i></b></p></blockquote>
