      <h2><a href="#">  Lily’s Sweet Success</a></h2>
      <h3> </h3>
      <br>
      <section>

       <p> Once upon a time, in a small village surrounded by green hills, there lived a young girl named Lily. Everyone in her village knew her for her bright smile and kind heart. However, Lily had one big worry: her schoolwork. She found it very difficult. Math problems confused her, and she couldn’t remember historical dates. They were all mixed up in her mind.</p>
       <br>
       <p>Lily’s parents were worried too, because in their village, doing well in school was seen as the only way to success. There was an important exam coming up, and everyone expected that passing it was crucial for a good future. But Lily, with her grades, felt like she was facing an impossible challenge.
       </p>
       <br>
       <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Universal Pic/Universal 7/LSS1.jpg" alt="" /><b></b></span> 
       <br>
       <p> One day, Lily met an old woman named Mrs. Ada while walking through the market. Mrs. Ada was known for her wisdom and had a kind way of looking at things differently. Seeing Lily’s sad face, Mrs. Ada asked her what was wrong. Lily shared her worries about the upcoming exam and how she felt doomed to fail.
            <br><br>
            Mrs. Ada listened carefully, then smiled gently. “Lily,” she said, “school is important, but it’s not the only place to learn or to succeed. What do you love to do?”
            <br><br>
            Lily thought for a moment, and then her face lit up. “I love to bake! I help my mom in the kitchen, and I enjoy making cakes and cookies.”
            <br><br>
            “Well, there you go!” Mrs. Ada exclaimed. “Why don’t you focus on what you’re good at? Maybe you won’t pass this exam, but that doesn’t mean you can’t be successful.”
      </p>
            <br>
      <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Universal Pic/Universal 7/LSS2.jpg" alt="" /><b></b></span>
      <br>
            <p>  Mrs. Ada’s words encouraged Lily to start baking more often. She experimented with recipes and even created her own. Her confidence grew as she shared her baked goods with neighbors and friends, who praised her delicious treats.
                  <br><br>
                  When the exam day came, Lily did her best, but as she expected, she did not pass. However, instead of feeling defeated, Lily had a new plan. With her parents’ support, she started selling her baked goods at the local market. Her stall became popular quickly, and soon she was known across nearby villages for her baking skills.
            <br><br>
            Years passed, and Lily’s small stall turned into a lovely little bakery in the heart of the village. She employed her friends and even taught baking classes to children, sharing her passion and joy.
      </p>
            <br>
     <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Universal Pic/Universal 7/LSS3.jpg" alt="" /><b></b></span>
     <br>
     <p>  Lily learned that success isn’t just about passing exams or excelling in school. It’s about finding what you love and doing it well. Her bakery didn’t just bring her success; it brought happiness to her and to everyone who visited. And so, Lily lived happily, filling her life and her village with the sweet aroma of cakes and the warmth of her joyful heart.
