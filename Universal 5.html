                  <h2>  Vamshi's Cricket Journey </h2> <hr/>
                  
      <p> <span class="image right"><img src="images/Universal Pic/Universal 5/cc.jpg" alt="" /><b></b></span>
            From a young age, Vamshi had a lifelong enthusiasm for sports.<br>
            Vamshi used to spend a lot of time in his backyard as a kid honing his cricket shots in the hopes of one day playing professionally. His parents were aware of his talent and commitment, and they made sure to encourage him by signing him up for cricket camps and getting him the required gear. 
            </p>

      <p> <span class="image left"><img src="images/Universal Pic/Universal 5/cc1.jpg" alt="" /><b></b></span> 
            Vamshi’s enthusiasm for the game developed as he got older. He was a cricket player for his school, where he soon rose to the position of star player. Scouts saw his talent, and he finally received a scholarship offer from a collegiate team.<br>
            Vamshi put forth a lot of effort to establish himself as a useful player, both on and off the pitch. He practiced his shots and researched the rules of the game for endless hours. He also took care to maintain his academic progress since he recognized the need for a fallback position. Vamshi’s dedication paid off, and he rose to the position of a star player on his collegiate squad. A professional team eventually scouted him and made a contract offer.<br>
            Although Vamshi’s goal had come true, he was aware that there was still much work to be done. He persisted in working hard, challenging himself to improve even more. He practiced his technique and developed his talents for a long period of time in the gym and on the court.
            </p>

      <p> <span class="image right"><img src="images/Universal Pic/Universal 5/cc2.jpg" alt="" /><b></b></span> 
            Vamshi persisted despite encountering countless obstacles and setbacks along the route, never losing sight of the goal. He eventually rose to prominence as one of cricket’s most successful players, thanks to his dedication and hard work.
