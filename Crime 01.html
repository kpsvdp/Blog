     <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Crime pic/Crime 1/shd0.jpg" alt="" /><b></b></span> 
     <p>  Inthe small town of Nagole, the evening was cold and wet. The lights’ low illumination cast strange shadows on the wet sidewalk, and the streets were empty. The seventeen-year-old Pooja stood by herself in a bedroom in a beautiful little home outside of the city, watching out the window at the pouring rainfall. An internal mystery haunted her, one she could no longer keep secret.
      <br><br>
            Throughout her life, Pooja had been a quiet, introverted girl who enjoyed reading mysteries instead of chatting with her friends. She had fallen madly in love with Babu, a charming young guy who had captured her heart, for over a year. They whispered passionate promises to each other under the moonlight, and they secretly kissed each other in the college corridors.
            <br><br>
            Nobody was aware, meanwhile, that Pooja had discovered a terrible truth about Babu. He was a member of a lethal gang, and his way of life was one of lying and irresponsibility. Pooja happened to find an amount of cocaine in Babu’s backpack while she and Babu were studying together.
            </p>
            <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Crime pic/Crime 1/shd1.jpg" alt="" /><b></b></span> 
            <p>   Fearful of what she had discovered,Pooja faced Babu that fateful evening. She pleaded with him to leave the organization and follow a different path in life. She was devoted to her fellow criminals, though, and he was unwilling to give up his odd life. Pooja got angry as the argument got hotter and hit Babu in the head with a big vessel that was nearby. He fell after hitting the ground, mumbling.
                  <br><br>
                  Pooja’s heart rushed inside her chest as she looked at the boy’s unmoved body. The feeling of panic passed through her, and she knew she had to act quickly. After dragging Babu’s lifeless body into the garage, she concealed him behind a pile of dirty blankets and tools. Tears streamed down her face as she realized how terrible what she had done was.
                  <br><br>
                  For a few weeks, Pooja managed to keep her terrible secret a secret. She acted like nothing was out of the ordinary as she headed to school, carrying the weight of her actions like a stone in her chest. She knew she could no longer live with her regret, though, since it was killing her.
            </p>
             <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Crime pic/Crime 1/shd2.jpg" alt="" /><b></b></span> 
                  <p>   One evening, she confessed to her best friend Lily her terrible secret. The two girls concluded that to be moral, they had to accept responsibility for their actions. They called the police and told them where Babu’s body was located in the garage.
                        <br><br>
                  The question that followed shocked Nagole to no end. After news of Babu’s illegal operations spread, his organization came under attack, and Pooja was taken into custody and accused of killing someone. The little village would never be the same.
            </p>
            <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Crime pic/Crime 1/shd3.jpg" alt="" /><b></b></span> 
            <p>     In the end, Pooja’s love for Babu had led her down an unsafe and dangerous path. It was a repeating reminder of the serious lying that had ended their relationship, and she would never forget the rainy night she killed him with a vessel.
            </p>
