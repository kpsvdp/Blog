They create stories of great tragedy, solve mysterious riddles, and dance gracefully between love and pain, giving each sentence breath.</p1>

       <br>         
       <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Universal Pic/Universal 1/dog1.jpg" alt="" /><b></b></span> 
            <p>A lonely puppy named Tiger once lived in an attractive little village hidden away between rolling mountains and beautiful meadows. He was the cutest and friendliest puppy in the entire town. Tiger could make anyone’s heart melt with his soft, caramel-colored fur, soulful eyes, and spreading tail wag. But despite his attraction, he didn’t have something very important: a boy to call his own.
            <br> <br>
            Tiger walked around the village every day, trying to find a friend to drive him home. He watched jealously as other puppies played joyfully with their human friends. Tiger imagined having a boy to play fetch with, run through the fields with, and give him massages. He yearned for the warmth and affection that could only come from a devoted boy.
            </p>
            <br> 
       <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Universal Pic/Universal 1/dog2.jpg" alt="" /><b></b></span>
            <p>Tiger came across a young boy named Sai sitting by himself on a park bench one colorful morning as he walked the village. Sai provided a frustrated and lost-in-thought vibe. Tiger felt a surge of feelings and knew he had located the young man he had been looking for.
            <br> <br>
            Tiger carefully walked up to Sai, sat down next to him, and gently rubbed Sai’s hand. Sai looked into Tiger’s eyes, surprised but happy, and an unbreakable bond between the two was established at that very moment. 
            </p>
            <br> 
      <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Universal Pic/Universal 1/dog3.jpg" alt="" /><b></b></span>
            <p> Tiger and Sai became unbreakable after that day. Together, they explored the village, met new people, and made priceless memories. Through difficult times, they supported one another by joking around and playing. Tiger’s boundless energy and unconditional devotion made Sai happy, and Tiger received love and care from Sai in return.
            <br> <br>
            Sai, who was previously a quiet and lonesome boy, caught the village’s attention as he changed. He was now laughing broadly, improving the entire town. Tiger’s presence had made Sai and everyone else happy.
            <br> <br>
            As the years went by, Tiger developed into a dependable friend. Together, he and Sai underwent a variety of adventures, overcoming their fears and appreciating the value of friendship. They came by each other through thick and thin, celebrated wins, and weathered storms together. 
            </p>
            <br> 
      <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Universal Pic/Universal 1/dog4.jpg" alt="" /><b></b></span> 
      <p>   Sai learned important life lessons from Tiger, including the value of being present in the present and the need for compassion. In exchange, Tiger learned from Sai about kindness, compassion, and the joy of being loved.
            <br> <br>
            Beyond the village, the expression of Tiger and Sai’s romance quickly spread. Their relationship served as an example for others, a reminder of the extraordinary bond between animals and people, and an example of the transformative power of love.
            <br> <br>
            Therefore, in the end, it was true that every puppy should have a boy to care for them and share their life’s journey, creating a lovely story of friendship and devotion that would be loved for generations. When a puppy meets the ideal boy and they find true love, as in Tiger and Sai’s case, magic happens, and they live happily ever after.
