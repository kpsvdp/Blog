                  <h2> Love Renewed and Found </h2>
                  <h3>PART 03</h3> <hr/>
                  
      <p> <span class="image left"><img src="images/Love&Break Pic/NVV 3/nvv3.1.jpg" alt="" /><b></b></span>
            Neel wants to know where you have been. Why do you sound so boring? What’s up with Viraj? How do you feel? Then Veena queries “I’m fine right now,” Neel answered. Veena asked him again about what had happened.
            </p>

      <p> <span class="image right"><img src="images/Love&Break Pic/NVV 3/nvv3.2.jpg" alt="" /><b>Neel and Veena in Park</b></span> 
            I planned to see you today at University Park at 4:00, Veena told me. Neel said, "Alright," and suddenly Veena cut the conversation off.<br>
            At a park, they first met. Veena appeared different from Neel; she was worn out and broken. Veena began to speak. “Neel, I have to share something with you. Viraj deceives people. He never truly cared for me. Behind my back, he was seeing another girl”.<br>
            Neel was hearing things that he couldn’t believe. Viraj had always seemed like a decent guy to him, but it appears that he was mistaken all along.<br>
            Reshma went on: “After I parted ways with Viraj, I gave our relationship a lot of thought. I now see that leaving you was a mistake. Neel, I love you. I always have and will continue to. Forgive me, please.”
            </p>
            
      <p> <span class="image left"><img src="images/Love&Break Pic/NVV 3/nvv3.3.jpg" alt="" /><b>Neel & Veena</b></span>
            With that, Veena got up and walked away, leaving Neel to ponder over his feelings. He knew that he still loved her, but he also knew that he needed to be careful before giving her another chance.<br>
            Neel kept thinking about Veena as the days went by. He understood that he still adored her and yearned for her to return to his life. He called her and expressed his feelings for her.<br>
            Neel and Veena reunited as a result. They resolved their previous conflicts and developed a closer bond than ever. They came to the conclusion that occasionally love merits a second chance and that the person you thought was one is actually the one.
            </p>
