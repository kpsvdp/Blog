            <p class="description"></pclass> John’s first-day University</p>
            <P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> John arrived in the UK with high hopes and expectations, but reality soon hit him. Life in the UK was not as easy as he had imagined. The cost of living was much higher than he had anticipated, and he was struggling to make ends meet. He was paying for his tuition, food, and room, and he barely had enough money left over for anything else. Despite these challenges, John was determined to make it work. He knew that this was his chance to make a better life for himself and his family, and he was not going to let anything stop him. He started to live frugally, cooking his meals at home and walking everywhere to save on transportation costs. He also increased his efforts to find work, putting in long hours and dedicating himself to finding a solution. One day, John received a call from a local restaurant offering him a part-time job as a server. He was overjoyed, and he eagerly accepted the position. Working at the restaurant was hard work, but it was also a lot of fun. John made many new friends, and he even learned how to cook some of the restaurant’s signature dishes. As time went by, John’s finances started to stabilize. He was able to pay his bills, buy the things he needed, and even save a little bit of money for the future. He was also able to focus more on his studies, and he started to make progress academically.</P1></li>

Esta was warm and friendly, and John was immediately drawn to her. As they got to know each other better, John realized that Esta was from a similar background to him and that she understood the challenges he was facing. She was empathetic and supportive, always encouraging John to chase his dreams.

She was a bright spot in his life and helped him to stay focused and motivated. John felt grateful to have met such a wonderful person who truly cared about him.
