                  <h2> The Student Life Abroad </h2> <hr/>
                  
      <p> <span class="image left"><img src="images/Author Pic/chapter 0/J1.JPG" alt="" /><b>John's memory abroad</b></span> 
            John was a young man from a small village in India who had always dreamed of obtaining a higher education. He was an ambitious and determined student, and when he was offered a scholarship to study in the United Kingdom, he jumped at the opportunity.<br>
            John arrived in the UK with high hopes and expectations, but reality soon hit him. Life in the UK was not as easy as he had imagined. The cost of living was much higher than he had anticipated, and he was struggling to make ends meet. He was paying for his tuition, food, and room, and he barely had enough money left over for anything else.
      </p>
     
      <p> <span class="image right"><img src="images/Author Pic/chapter 0/J2.JPG" alt="" /><b>John’s first-day University</b></span>
            Despite these challenges, John was determined to make it work. He knew that this was his chance to make a better life for himself and his family, and he was not going to let anything stop him. He started to live frugally, cooking his meals at home and walking everywhere to save on transportation costs. He also increased his efforts to find work, putting in long hours and dedicating himself to finding a solution.<br>
            One day, John received a call from a local restaurant offering him a part-time job as a server. He was overjoyed, and he eagerly accepted the position. Working at the restaurant was hard work, but it was also a lot of fun. John made many new friends, and he even learned how to cook some of the restaurant’s signature dishes.<br>
            As time went by, John’s finances started to stabilize. He was able to pay his bills, buy the things he needed, and even save a little bit of money for the future. He was also able to focus more on his studies, and he started to make progress academically.
      </p>

      <p> <span class="image left"><img src="images/Author Pic/chapter 0/J3.JPG" alt="" /><b>Joy & initial affection never disappear</b></span>
            John was a hardworking young man who had always dreamed of having a successful career in the restaurant industry. He had worked his way up from the bottom, starting as a dishwasher and eventually becoming a chef. Despite his passion for cooking, John struggled to balance his work and personal life.<br>
            One day, while working at the restaurant, John met a girl named Esta. She was a server, and they were both assigned to work the same shift. From the moment they met, they felt an instant connection. Esta was warm and friendly, and John was immediately drawn to her.<br>
            As they got to know each other better, John realized that Esta was from a similar background to him and that she understood the challenges he was facing. She was empathetic and supportive, always encouraging John to chase his dreams.<br>
            Their relationship grew stronger with each passing day, and John found himself looking forward to going to work just so he could see Esta. She was a bright spot in his life and helped him to stay focused and motivated. John felt grateful to have met such a wonderful person who truly cared about him.<br>
            One day, while they were out on a date, John mustered up the courage to tell Esta how much she meant to him.
      </p>

      <p> <span class="image right"><img src="images/Author Pic/chapter 0/J4.JPG" alt="" /><b>Life is extremely challenging abroad</b></span>
            John’s hard work and dedication paid off in the end. He graduated with honors, and he was soon offered a job at a Google company as a software developer. He was overjoyed and grateful for the opportunities that had come his way.<br>
            John’s life in the UK continued to flourish. He made many new friends, found love with Esta, and even started his own business. He had finally found a place where he belonged, and he was grateful for the journey that had led him to where he is today.
      </p>

      <p> <span class="image left"><img src="images/Author Pic/chapter 0/J5.JPG" alt="" /><b>Dream Job</b></span>
            Years later, when John looked back on his life, he was proud of what he had accomplished. He had overcome adversity and built a new life in a foreign country. He was a true testament to the power of determination and hard work, and he was grateful for the journey that had led him to where he was today.<br>
            John often thought about his family back home in India, and he was grateful for their love and support. He knew that he would always be connected to his roots, no matter where life took him. And so, he continued to live his life with gratitude, always looking for new opportunities and new adventures.
