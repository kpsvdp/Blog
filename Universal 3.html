       <p> The aircraft’s engines were humming steadily as it flew into the cloudy skies. Unaware of the horrible nightmare that awaited them, people sat down inside the cabin.
            <br><br>
            As the aircraft continued to vibrate from turbulence, the passengers became afraid and lost their calm. The captain’s voice over the intercom calmed their fears, explaining that atmospheric circumstances were what were causing the abrasive air. With apprehensive looks, they exchanged glances. But the discomfort persisted.
            </p>
            <br>
      <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Universal Pic/Universal 3/FTFS2.JPG" alt="" /><b></b></span>
            <p> The plane was suddenly enveloped in a swirling mass of dark clouds in the middle of the trip as a storm materialized out of nowhere. The cabin was filled with unsettling shadows as lightning sparked menacingly all around them. The jet was being tossed around as the turbulence grew more intense. Screams and roaring winds combined to cause panic among the passengers.
                  <br><br>
            The plane’s instruments began to flicker, displaying abnormal data and broken systems. The news that the plane had lost contact with air traffic control and was now stranded in the storm caused the captain’s voice to get strained as he delivered it. The increasing turmoil made everyone’s anxieties more intense as passengers exchanged horrified stares.
            <br><br>
            A passenger saw a succession of tiny cracks forming along the window next to them amid the commotion. Frightened, they warned the flight attendants, who quickly sealed the area to protect the passengers. 
            </p>
            <br>
      <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Universal Pic/Universal 3/FTFS3.JPG" alt="" /><b></b></span>
            <p> The cabin lights flickered and dimmed as the aircraft fought the storm’s force. As the air conditioner fought to keep up, the atmosphere became stuffy. As oxygen masks began to fall, a wave of terror spread among the passengers as they scrambled to secure them as confidence in the aircraft’s integrity started to decline.
                  <br><br>
            With every passing minute, the situation grew worse. The engines stuttered to life, the once-dependable hum giving way to panicked wheezing. When the captain’s voice faltered and he declared that they would have to make an emergency landing, the passengers steeled themselves for the hit. 
            </p>
            <br>
      <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Universal Pic/Universal 3/FTFS4.JPG" alt="" /><b></b></span> 
            <p> The terrified passengers gripped their seats with white knuckles as the plane dropped through the storm. Their delicate situation became much more uncertain when the landing gear failed to deploy. The aircraft’s damaged structure groaned under the strain as it made a forceful impact on the runway. As the plane slid to a stop, emergency crews hurried to the site, their lights piercing the darkness. A mixture of relief and disbelief could be seen on the faces of the passengers as they stumbled out onto the tarmac. Finally, the end of their long trip had arrived.
                  <br><br>
            The full scope of the incident only gradually came to light as investigators dug through the destruction. It soon became apparent that a succession of unfortunate incidents, unexpected weather, technical problems, and a confluence of other factors had combined to provide a terrible in-flight experience. The strange memories of the plane crash would stay with the survivors for the rest of their lives, serving as a constant reminder of how fleeting life is among the vast expanse of the skies.
