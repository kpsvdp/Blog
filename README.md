This image appears to be a login and sign-up interface for a web application. On the right side, users can log in by entering their username and password, with the option to sign in via social platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Google. There’s also a "Forgot your password?" link for users who need to recover access.

On the left side, new users are greeted with a “Hello, Friend!” message, inviting them to sign up and start their journey by entering personal details. The rocket illustration conveys a theme of launching or beginning a new journey, adding a motivational touch to the sign-up process.
