                  <h3>chapter 04</h3> <hr/>

                   <blockquote><p><span class="image Fit right"><img src="" alt="" /><b></b></span>
                        <b><i> “Prince, Suman, and Rashmi are all fourth-graders. For a change, kids are now content with their childlike state, which is occasionally terrible. separating them.”</i></b></p></blockquote>
                        <p>But one day, Prince’s father was transferred to a new city for work, and the family had to leave Karminagar. Prince was devastated to leave his friends and the town he had called home for so long.
                        </p>
                  
      <p> <span class="image left"><img src="images/Author Pic/chapter 4/AMM1.JPG" alt="" /><b>Rashmi and Suman goodbye to Prince</b></span>
            Rashmi and Suman were likewise devastated to lose their best buddy. Prince also experienced joy from the school principal. However, Prince also experienced sadness at his friends departing for school.The final few days before Prince’s departure were spent creating memories and making a commitment to keep in touch. <br>
            Suman and Rashmi stood at the edge of town with tears running down their faces as Prince’s family left. Despite the fact that they were aware that their friend was beginning a new chapter in his life, they also understood that he would always hold a particular place in their hearts.
            </p>
     
      <p> <span class="image right"><img src="images/Author Pic/chapter 4/AMM2.JPG" alt="" /><b>Prince Bye Bye..</b></span>
            Prince turned to see his two closest friends smiling alongside the vehicle carrying him and his family out of Karimnagar. He seemed certain that their bond of friendship would last despite the distance that now separated them.
             </p>

      <p> <span class="image left"><img src="images/Author Pic/chapter 4/AMM3.JPG" alt="" /><b>Prince in dreams….</b></span>
            Prince reflected back to his days in Karimnagar, and his heart was full of sadness. The impact of his friends’ dreams and laughter sounded true, and their relationship was unbreakable by distance. Every memory was a priceless memory that strengthened the friendship that stretched across distances and was always present in his goals.
