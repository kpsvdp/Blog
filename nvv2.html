            <p2>Love is a powerful energy that has the power to either cause or heal the most painful injuries. Though it sometimes leaves us silently, holding onto memories rather than hands, it whispers promises of forever. It tells us that even broken hearts may heal and start to beat again.</p2>

     <p>  Neel is becoming stronger and trying to get stronger.
      <br><br>
            After the betrayal of his friend Viraj and the heartbreak of his failed relationship with Veena, Neel was left feeling lost and alone. He struggled to come to terms with the fact that those closest to him had hurt him so deeply, and he found it difficult to trust others.
            <br><br>
            In the weeks and months following the betrayal, Neel became increasingly withdrawn. He stopped spending time with his other friends and stopped engaging in activities that he once enjoyed. Anger, hurt, and bitterness dominated him, and he was unable to find a way out of his suffering.
            <br><br>
            However, as time passed, Neel slowly began to realize that he needed to take control of his own happiness. He started focusing on his own interests and hobbies, such as playing music, drawing pictures, and writing novels. He also sought out new experiences and met new people who helped him see the world in a different way.
            </p>
            <br>
      <blockquote><p><b> Unexpectedly, as he was readjusting to daily life, the past struck again.</b></p></blockquote>
      <br>
       <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Love&Break Pic/NVV 2/nvv2.2.jpg" alt="Neel is thinking about Veena" /><b><cite>Neel is thinking about Veena</cite></b></span>
            <p> For what seemed like a lifetime, Neel had been attempting to get over the hurt and grief of his failed relationship with Veena. He had severed all ties with her and had been putting a lot of effort into getting his heart’s wounds healed.
                  <br><br>
                However, one day, Veena unexpectedly contacted him. Although Rahul was nervous to talk to her, there was something in her voice that touched him. Neel spent his brief time thinking about his love life, his melancholy, his happiness, etc.
