        <p class="description"></pclass><i> Let's continue Prince's trip at D.A.V. Public School, focusing on the expanding friendships and the interesting environment of the school.</i></p>
    
        <li> <img src="images/Author Pic/Chapter 7/tab.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="description"></pclass>   </p>
            <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class>Prince became more and more connected to the D.A.V. Public School community as his Hindi language skills developed under Nikita's gentle guidance. He could now see a world full of opportunities and friendships as the wall that had once separated them began to fall apart.  
            </P1></li>
            <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> To offer a comprehensive education, the school encouraged student involvement in various extracurricular activities. Prince threw himself into it with greater assurance. His quickness was evident when he joined his school's football team. On the football field, language barriers did not matter because of his abilities. He was selected to start as goalkeeper for the school's football team.
            </P1></li>
            <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> Prince's selection for the school football team was allegedly made only because of his father's coaching role, according to some of the students. When Prince heard about these rumours, he was disheartened and started to regret his decision to join the team. But after a few days, his friends rallied around him, telling him to put his game first and ignore all the criticism.

        <p class="description"></pclass> After some days...  </p>
        <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class>In a strange turn of events, the school divided its students into separate houses, each named after revered elements. Together with her princely friends, Nikita arrived at Agni House, which was known for its fiery attitude and vibrant energy. The prince was placed in Vayu House, which is renowned for the grace and speed of the wind, in the interim. A new chapter in their daily lives was initiated when the students were divided into the Agni House, Aditya House, Vayu House, and Angira Houses. This encouraged a spirit of friendship mixed with competition as they embarked on this unique academic and personal journey. 
        </P1></li>
        <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> Prince faced challenges at Vayu House because of the group's low participation and weak teamwork. The group's lack of ambition for leadership caused several problems that affected its performance as a whole. While in Vayu House, Prince had developed and made new friends, but something unexpected happened that resulted in a big shift.
        </P1></li> 
        <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> After facing difficulties, Prince decided to go back to Agni House with his friends. There, he found a more vibrant and encouraging atmosphere that was more closely aligned with his values. Prince reconnected with Nikita and his other friends when Agni House was formally assigned to him as a result of a redesign of the house structure. Prince experienced conflicting feelings as a result of this change; although he was happy to be back with his close friends, he was also a little sorry to be losing the relationships he had made at Vayu House. But his time in Vayu House had given him useful abilities for adjusting to different environments and social circles, so his move to Agni House went much more easily than he thought possible.
        </P1></li>

  <li> <img src="images/Author Pic/Chapter 7/tab2.jpg" alt="">
    <p class="description"></pclass>   </p>
    <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> The prince noticed that Agni House had a unique but comfortable atmosphere. Agni House was well known for promoting cultural activities, learning skills, and athletics alike. In this case, Prince has more opportunities to follow his hobbies. He became a member of the debate team and contributed to improving his critical thinking and language skills. Participating in discussions helped him understand a range of local and national topics better, and it also helped him think more clearly and speak in front of an audience. His other friends, Nikita among them, supported him in his new interests by attending his debates and offering constructive criticism.
    </P1></li>
    <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> Agni House helped Prince hone his leadership abilities and strengthen the bonds that bind the entire community. They worked well together to organize cultural events and competed against other houses. When he combined his previous roles in Vayu House with his transformation from a shy beginner to an inspiring leader in Agni House, his experience at school was greatly enhanced.
    </P1></li>
    <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> During this entire procedure,. His last exam was taken close to his friends. He started getting ready for his test, and other people joined him for study sessions and activities. However, he is unable to participate in any activities because of his academic struggles. He struggles with the educational system, which keeps him from picking up the skills he needs in class.
    </P1></li>

    <p class="description"></pclass>   </p>
    <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> After getting good scores on his tests, the prince felt more at ease and happy. In addition to his improved academic standing, he was selected to participate in a school football game, which was a thrilling experience. He started working hard on the football field because he wanted to make a name for himself in both sports and academia.
    </P1></li> 
    <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class>Prince's passion for football has now overtaken his earlier struggles in the classroom. He raced to the football field every day after school with great excitement. His longtime friends, who had previously joined him in games during study sessions, were with him there. These friends now supported him and gave him tips on how to improve his football performance while they stood by his side on the field. 
    </P1></li> 
    <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> The schedule for the upcoming football matches was announced at school. Prince was not playing in actual matches yet, but he was still very good in practice. The team's problem was that they could only have one goalkeeper for the game. This presented a big obstacle and highlighted the need for more talented players to fill that position to guarantee the team's success in the upcoming tournaments.

    <p class="description"></pclass> Match dayâ€¦...  </p>
    <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class>Bishrampur and Bilaspur met in a highly anticipated football comeback that was expected to be highly competitive. With Prince in goal, the Bishrampur team initially had high expectations, but they quickly ran into problems. Prince, whose goalkeeping abilities were frequently challenged, found the game especially difficult. Bilaspur controlled the game from the start, taking advantage of holes in Bishrampur's defence. They scored the opening goal immediately, and then Bishrampur was down 0â€“4 at halftime due to their constant attack. 
    </P1></li> 
    <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> Prince's goalkeeping was poor, and the Bishrampur team had trouble establishing a consistent playing philosophy. The disappointment was audible throughout the stadium as the once-enthusiastic crowd and students grew restless. Most people thought Prince's awful goalkeeping was the main cause of Bishrampur's poor performance.
    </P1></li> 
    <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> As the second half began, an amazing turn of events saw Bishrampur try a comeback, managing to score three goals. Intending to make it 3â€“5, Bilaspur, however, continued to lead. Even when Bishrampur gave a better performance, the tension continued. As the criticism increased and rumours circulated regarding his father's influence on his choice of team, Prince began to lose trust. On the field, he faced even more pressure from the students' whispers, who challenged his skills and suspected him of favouritism. While Bishrampur made a valiant effort to get closer to the score while Bilaspur attempted to widen their lead, the final score remained 3â€“5.
    </P1></li> 
    <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> Prince's determination and concentration as the goalkeeper were closely tracked since the game's result rested on his shoulders. It remained to be seen.
    </P1></li> 
    
    <li><P1 class="description"></P1class><i> If Prince could rise above these difficulties and guide Bishrampur to victory, or if the pressure would be too much and his team would lose in the face of growing criticism and negativity,????? </i> </P1></li>
