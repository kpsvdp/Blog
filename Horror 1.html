            <p class="description"></pclass> </p>
            <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> A young boy named Pavan lived in a small, scary village hidden between scary, low mountains. His life was a patchwork of unsettling difficulties. With no loving support from devoted friends or controlling parents, Pavan’s life was covered in mystery and full of secret spaces and issues.
            </P1></li>
            <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class>His mind was a battlefield of perverted ideas, driven not by academic interests but by a darker passion. The class lessons hinted at unclear, mysterious concepts, causing him to shift his focus from the ordinary to the extraordinary. Strange, unknown mysteries appeared to vibrate through the college’s corridors, haunting Pavan’s thoughts.
             </P1></li> 
            <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class>Pavan’s body was a prison of weakness and tiredness, betraying him at every turn. He was weak and continuously troubled by illness. His health was a continuous enemy, adding a layer of physical suffering to his emotional battles despite his attempts to live somewhat of a regular life. 
            </P1></li>
            <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class>His family’s financial challenges just made the sense of fear grow more serious, creating a never-ending cycle of being poor and missing opportunities. Every chance missed seemed like a step further into a never-ending darkness from which there looked to be no escape. 
            </P1></li>
            <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> Pavan’s deep-seated sadness and shame shifted his need for company, particularly from another person. It pained him to wonder why anyone would want to be with someone who was so consumed in darkness and unhappiness.
            </P1></li>
            <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class>But what pushed Pavan to his death were the invisible forces—the suggestions of something evil that waited in the town’s shadows. Locked in a never-ending cycle of hopelessness, he was driven to the dark arts in an attempt to find comfort in the prohibited and unfamiliar.
            </P1></li>
            <li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> As the little youngster went deeper into the invisible, his quest became a terrifying tale of terror. His once-harmless dreams turned into nightmares, turning him into a spectre of terror and despair that pursued the streets he had once travelled. He was trapped in a world he had created, one in which every silence cried out of unbelievable horrors and every shadow was hidden as a nightmare.
