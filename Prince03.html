                  <h2> Friends Beyond Distance </h2>
                  <h3>Chapter 03</h3> <hr/>
                  
      <p> <span class="image left"><img src="images/Author Pic/chapter 3/BD.JPG" alt="" /><b>Prince, Suman and Rashmi</b></span>
            Three young friends from the town of Karimnagar formerly lived there: Prince, Suman, and Rashmi. They were all attending school and enrolled in the same tuition classes, even though they were all under the age of three.
       </p>
     
      <p> <span class="image right"><img src="images/Author Pic/chapter 3/BD1.JPG" alt="" /><b>Prince, Suman and Rashmi</b></span>
            While learning, playing, and occasionally fighting, they would engage in conversation with one another.<br>
            The three buddies interact, read, and play together. There is a tiny joke that Suman tells Rashmi about how the tuition teacher punished me and the prince because of the princePrince brought a crane bundle into the classroom. However, it wasn’t a crane. Rashmi, please explain what is in there, and then she abruptly replied, “I don’t know.” Suman responded that red sand was brought to class in a packet. Then, as punishment, the tutor kept both in a pitch-black room for an hour.<br>
            After his parents and mine arrived for class, the tutor informed them of everything.
       </p>

            Sometimes they would fight over snacks or toys, but their bond was solid enough to stand up to any argument. They frequently promptly made up, and their bond remained unshakeable. Their parents were astounded by how well-behaved these little kids got along with one another.
      </p>

      <p> <span class="image right"><img src="images/Author Pic/chapter 3/BD3.JPG" alt="" /><b>Prince & Suman</b></span>
            Despite the fact that they occasionally quarreled, they were always quick to forget and forgive. They would defend one another in any circumstance and always be there for one another. They were focused on doing well in their studies despite their youth. They would assist one another with their assignments and collaborate when studying for tests. They collaborated to accomplish their objectives, acting as a small team.
      </p>

      <p> <span class="image left"><img src="images/Author Pic/chapter 3/BD4.JPG" alt="" /><b>Prince, Suman and Rashmi</b></span>
            Their parents were proud of how their children had formed such a close bond with each other. They knew that these little friends would be there for each other through thick and thin, no matter what.
