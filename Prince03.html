              <li></li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class>While learning, playing, and occasionally fighting, they would engage in conversation with one another.  
            </P1></li>
              <li></li><P1 class="custom-font-size"></P1class> The three buddies interact, read, and play together. There is a tiny joke that Suman tells Rashmi about how the tuition teacher punished me and the prince because of the princePrince brought a crane bundle into the classroom. However, it wasn’t a crane. Rashmi, please explain what is in there, and then she abruptly replied, “I don’t know.” Suman responded that red sand was brought to class in a packet. Then, as punishment, the tutor kept both in a pitch-black room for an hour.
