            <p2>Love is a powerful energy that has the power to either cause or heal the most painful injuries. Though it sometimes leaves us silently, holding onto memories rather than hands, it whispers promises of forever. It tells us that even broken hearts may heal and start to beat again.</p2>

      <p>     
      <strong><cite>Neel</cite></strong> is a multifaceted character who combines a number of characteristics. He is quiet yet has a propensity for overthinking things, and he is self-centered but also foolish.
      <br><br> 
      <strong><cite>Viraj</cite></strong> has harmful and self-centered inclinations, yet he hides these traits under a false front of goodness. He is a mysterious, quiet man who can betray others, giving him a complex personality.
      <br> <br>
      <strong><cite>Veena</cite></strong> is a character that straddles the moral line; her tendencies to overanalyze things and her combination of ego, selfishness, and a well-known air of arrogance are characteristics that define her.
      <br> 
      </p>
      <div class="box">
            <blockquote><p><b> A triangular love story involving Neel, Viraj, and Veena, navigating complex emotions and outcomes shaped by their distinct personalities.</b></p></blockquote>
       </div>
       <br> 
      <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Love&Break Pic/NVV 1/nvv1.2.jpg" alt="" /><b></b></span>
            <p> Neel and Viraj were buddies from their college years. They did everything together, even going after women. But when they met Veena, a fresh face in town, everything changed. She captured the hearts of both Viraj and Neel. Veena’s date request came from Neel, who was the first to approach her. Viraj was envious but refrained from interfering with his friend’s joy. When Neel and Veena first started dating, they were content.
                  <br> <br>
            But Viraj was unable to deny his affection for Veena. He made an effort to ignore them, but they got stronger as time went on. Despite his desire to avoid betraying his friend, he couldn’t help but think of Veena. Viraj told Veena about his feelings one day. Although she was shocked and taken aback, she was unable to suppress her love for Viraj. They began dating covertly because they didn’t want to upset Neel. 
            </p>
            <br> 
      <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Love&Break Pic/NVV 1/nvv1.3.jpg" alt="" /><b></b></span>
            <p>  Neel learned about their relationship. He felt misled and heartbroken. His best buddy and his girlfriend deceived him in such a way that he couldn’t believe it. Viraj and Veena attempted to explain their feelings when Neel approached them. But Neel was unable to pardon them. Both his friendship with Viraj and his romance with Veena came to an end.
                  <br> <br>
            Veena and Viraj were in shock. Neel’s friendship and trust had been lost to them. Yet they also felt relieved that they could now spend time together. They were aware that it was a difficult decision,but they went with love instead of friendship.
            <br> <br>
            Finally, Viraj and Veena ultimately made the decision to start over and leave their old lives behind. While savoring their romance and love, they were satisfied to reside in a single home.
            </p>
            <br> 
       <span class="image fit"><img src="images/Love&Break Pic/NVV 1/nvv1.4.jpg" alt="" /><b></b></span>
            <p>Although Viraj and Veena had been dating for many years, their relationship had suffered as a result of their busy lives. Both of them believed that they needed a new beginning to escape the craziness of their previous lives. After considerable consideration, they made the decision to go to a new location where they could start over and leave their employment, city, and former home behind.
                  <br> <br>
            Viraj and Veena discovered that they were more joyful than they had been in a long time as they grew accustomed to their new house. They enjoyed each other’s company, tried different meals, and explored the town during their free time. They were content to share a little house, and their only company was each other.
            <br> <br>
            They knew they had made the right choice to start afresh since their love and romance only got stronger with each passing day. They were appreciative of their fresh start and eager to live out the rest of their days in one another’s company.
